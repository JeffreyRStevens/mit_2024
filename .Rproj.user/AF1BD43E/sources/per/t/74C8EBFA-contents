Replicability in canine behavioral science: Lessons for conducting robust research

Replicable research is a cornerstone of robust science, but practices in the behavioral sciences have resulted in less-than-optimal outcomes. Here I use research in canine behavior and cognition to illustrate ways to improve the replicability of scientific research. In particular, I explore how big team science goes beyond typical team science to generate more robust results. On the way, we'll learn about dog impulsivity, social cognition, and numerical abilities.
